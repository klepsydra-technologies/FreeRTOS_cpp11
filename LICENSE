This directory contains number of subdirectories and files which are
covered with different licenses. 

* FreeRTOS_cpp11 library
The main product is FreeRTOS_cpp11 library (for short, called 
the library), located in FreeRTOS/cpp11_gcc subdirectory.
It is covered with MIT license.

* FreeRTOS - real time operating system
For the convinience of verification and validation, source of FreeRTOS
operating system, which is not part of the library, is included 
and located in FreeRTOS/source subdirectory. FreeRTOS is covered
with its own license which is stored in FreeRTOS/license subdirectory.

* GCC Runtime library
ARM GCC compiler for bare metal systems has certain parts of the Runtime
library excluded from its build. In order to enable full functionality of
the FreeRTOS_cpp11 library, three files: mutex.cc, future.cc and
condition_variable.cc must be included in the GCC build. For the user 
convinience, those 3 files are included in libstdc++_gcc subdirectory and 
linked with the test application. GCC runtime is covered with a license 
described in libstdc++_gcc/license subdirectory.

* Remaining files are demos and examples supplied by FreeRTOS or silicon 
vendors, some are part of a build system and library test files, etc. 
In case of doubts, each has a license text included at the top of the file.
